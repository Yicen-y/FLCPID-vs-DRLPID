# FLCPID-vs-DRLPID

Greeting to fellow readers who are interested in Fuzzy PID and/or Deep Reinforcement Learning-based PID, and/or autonomous ship simulation. I am Donald Cheng, a master student from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University who study Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems, and my dissertation project is a comparative analysis of Fuzzy Logic and Deep Reinforcement Learningâ€™s applications in PID Tuning for autonomous ships. I will be sharing my codes in how I apply Fuzzy Logic/Deep Reinforcement Learning in building an adaptive PID to improve an autonomous ship's performance in error reduction. The codes are in Python, and I will post the list of required libraries later. In addition, I will also upload my reference list used for this project, in case you want to know equations behind the codes. Last but not least, feel free to use my code and post any comments on this page, or contact me via donald_cheng1@hotmail.com if you have any questions.
